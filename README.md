# Customer Churn Prediction using Unsupervised Learning
## Project Overview
### This project focuses on predicting customer churn using unsupervised learning models. Churn prediction is a critical task for businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave and to take proactive measures to retain them. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on labeled data, this project leverages unsupervised learning techniques to detect patterns and anomalies in customer behavior, which can indicate potential churn.
